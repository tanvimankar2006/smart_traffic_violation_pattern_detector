# Smart Traffic AI Dashboard

## 🚦 Project Overview
The **Smart Traffic AI Dashboard** is a high-performance data analytics platform built with Python and Streamlit. It analyzes traffic violation data from across India to identify hotspots, seasonal patterns, and driver behavior trends. The dashboard provides actionable insights for traffic authorities and urban planners using advanced statistical visualizations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **UI Framework:** Streamlit
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, SciPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium (Maps)
- **Styling:** Custom CSS for a modern, dashboard-centric interface

## ✨ Key Features
- **Interactive Map Visualization:** Geographic hotspot analysis with interactive state-wise markers.
- **Advanced Statistical Analysis:** Density estimation (KDE), Violin plots for fine distribution, and Hexbin plots for speed correlation.
- **Temporal Pattern Recognition:** Hourly intensity heatmaps and weekly "velocity" charts.
- **5-Tab Deep Dive:** Detailed analysis of Violation Types, Payment Status, Environmental Factors, Agency Performance, and Vehicle Dynamics.
- **Modern KPI Tracking:** Real-time metrics for total violations, revenue, and average fines.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn folium scipy streamlit-folium`
